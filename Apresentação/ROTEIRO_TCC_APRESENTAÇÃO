BI na JFRN

1 - falar sobre a evolução do BI: já na década de 1970, com os computadores mais acessíveis para empresas, as tecnologias de banco de dados se desenvolveram, e passaram a ser usadas para controlar melhor o fluxo de caixa das empresas, e logo após isso passaram a ser usadas para determinar os melhores períodos para realizar promoções entre outras aplicações. Os primeiros usos desse tipo de tecnologia no judiciário foi em XXXX, no país XXXX, lá era usado para XXXX

In 1865, Richard Millar Devens presented the phrase “Business Intelligence” (BI) in the Cyclopædia of Commercial and Business Anecdotes. He was using it to describe how Sir Henry Furnese, a banker, profited from information by gathering and acting on it before his competition. More recently, in 1958, an article was written by an IBM computer scientist named Hans Peter Luhn, describing the potential of gathering Business Intelligence (BI) through the use of technology. Business intelligence, as it is understood today, uses technology to gather and analyze data, translate it into useful information, and act on it “before the competition.” Essentially, the modern version of BI focuses on technology a way to make decisions quickly and efficiently, based on the right information at the right time.

In 1968, only individuals with extremely specialized skills could translate data into usable information. At this time, data from multiple sources was normally stored in silos, and research was typically presented in a fragmented, disjointed report that was open to interpretation. Edgar Codd recognized this as a problem, and published a paper in 1970, altering the way people thought about databases. His  proposal of developing a “relational database model” gained tremendous popularity, and was adapted worldwide.

Decision Support Systems (DSS) was the first database management system to be developed. Many historians suggest the modern version of Business Intelligence evolved from the DSS database. The number of BI vendors grew in the 1980s, as business people discovered the value of Business Intelligence. An assortment of tools were developed during this time, with the goal of accessing and organizing data in simpler ways. OLAP, Executive Information Systems, and data warehouses were some of the tools developed to work with DSS.

Assim o BI se desenvolveu, atualmente engloba XXXX, visualização de dados, análise de dados (correlação e causalidade)
